      The search for developing alternate uses of Areca nut is based on finding best use for the various components of the nut and its traditional industrial and medicinal uses.<br>
      Areca tree is known to have several uses. The every components of the tree is used for one or the other purposes in human life. Many practices and uses of its components are not brought to picture due to ignorance, lack of interest, less scope for research and heavy investment requirement etc. To safeguard the future of Areca growers it is advisable some research need to be undertaken by business people, co-operatives, scholars, farmers, Universities and others connected.<br><br>
      Following are the different components of Areca:<br>
      1.Areca root<br>2.Areca tree<br>3.Areca nut<br>4.Areca tannin<br>5.Areca husk<br>6.Areca leaf<br>7.Areca flower
    </p> 
    <p>
      (I) TRADITIONAL USES OF ARECANUT AND ITS COMPONENTS:<br><br>
      1. Areca nut is already made available in the market with different varieties such as powdered quality, scented one, ‘gutkha’, 'pan masala' and 'mama' with zarda tobacco mix, sweet and masala forms and roasted small pieces in an attractive sachets and packets. There, still is lot of opportunity and potentiality of introducing in the form of slices, mumries, pieces or powder in different colors by adding its value with spices and chilli powder (Spicy and pungent areca nut) in  sachets'. In order to boost pan-beeda market in the domestic and foreign, long lasting ready-made pans may be made available in the attractive healthy packs or containers. Another possibility is that it could be developed as chewing gum. For this, necessary research may be undertaken. If it is achieved, market could be captured easily. Further, exploiting its physical and chemical properties, production of ideal mouth freshener could be thought of to attract the attention of Multinational Companies. Aesthetically, attractive and imaginative novelties can be made from areca nut taking advantage of the natural color and having variation on the surface. For instance, it can be used for preparing toys for small babies, garland, statues and different show case pieces by giving fine art touch on it. It can also be utilized in the production of various show case pieces, like paper weight. Considering its rich chemical and physical properties, already conducted pilot research in Mizoram State had promised that it could be useful in extracting liquor. Another experiment conducted in CFTRI - Mysore in Karnataka proved that it could be used in preparing beverage with betel leaves.
      Arecanut is usually used for chewing. Usually for chewing, a few slices of the nut are wrapped in a betel leaf along with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) and may include clove, cardamom, catechu (kattha), or other spices for extra flavouring.
      This is a common practice in India and is considered for its health benefits.Areca nuts are chewed with betel leaf for their effects as a mild stimulant,[4] causing a warming sensation in the body and slightly heightened alertness, although the effects vary from person to person.
      For this, the fruit is dried, processed and sliced as shown below.<br>

      Raw arecanut is harvested from farms by dealers and farmers are often paid based on the weight of fruit harvested.<br><br>
      2. Tannin (Chogaru):<br>
      Tannin is obtained as a by-product from the process of preparing immature betel nuts for masticator purposes. The sediments found in the tannin when it is dried, is called areca nut dust. Tannin in areca nut were being used for dyeing clothes and tanning leather. It can be used as an adhesive in ply board manufacture. Another possible use of areca tannin is as a safe food coloring agent. Black writing ink of acceptable quality may be prepared. Further, it is also useful in protecting house hold furniture by applying it like varnish. In the olden days tannin is used like paints to color walls. Traders use it to store areca for long duration by applying it. So that, necessary research may be undertaken to prepare acceptable wood oil  and gums by using tannin as a major ingredient. Department of Chemistry of Delhi University and Chemical Technology, University of Bombay had undertaken study to identify the properties of tannin to find out to its alternative uses.<br><br>

      3. Fats and its uses:<br>
      The areca nut contains 8-12 percent fatness. It can be extended by solvent extraction using hexane. It can be made edible by refining it using soda lime’. The refined areca fat is harder than cocoa, butter and even better, due to its high muriatic acid content. It could be softened by undergoing certain chemical processing and then it can be used as confectionery fat. Simple mixture of areca fat with butter fat at 3:1 ratio or with cocoa fat at 1:1 ratio could give product acceptable in confectioneries. Further, it could be used in preparation of biscuits, soaps, tea, chocolates, rasam powder, pickle, wine, herbal powder, cool drinks, syrup, gum, sweets, vinegar and savories and in place of vanaspati. Encouraging result have been obtained in preparing chewing gum and tooth paste using this extract of areca nut. Sweet supari making requires variety without fat.<br><br>
      4. Areanut husk and its products:<br>
      Husk is the outer cover or wrapper of the areca fruit which include 50-75 percent of the total volume and weight of the fruits. About 275000 tones of dry husk can be estimated annually in India. It is now everywhere in India being largely wasted except for being used as an inferior fuel, mulching and in manure. It was used in Indochina and Philippines for herbal tooth brushes. The biochemistry and physical properties of the husk have been studied by Baruah, Raghavan and Murthy (1957) and at the Jute Technological Research Laboratory (JRIL) Calcutta. The husk is anatomically divided into 3 zones. The outer layer covered with cuticles, the middle layer which encloses the fibers and the hard and stony inner layer addressed to the nut. JRTL having studied the physical properties of areca husk, identified its tenacity, fineness and textural rigidity. Based on the various tests, it proposed that fiber content could be used for making such items as thick, boards, fluffy cushions and non woven fabrics. Several studies have been carried out particularly in the Forest Research Institute (F.R.I.) Dehradun to see areca nut husk could be utilized for preparing hard board and plastics. As a result, it has been proved that plastic and hard boards of satisfactory strength and water repellent material can be made from areca husk. It can also be used in preparing boxes, cushioned envelops, soft boards, pillow, beds, etc., The studies carried out at the Central Food Technology Research Institute (CFTRI) Mysore (Karnataka), proved that areca husk could be chemically pulped and it can be used to prepare craft paper. However, to exploit the utility of areca husk in this line, problems of transporting husk to the factory point and the high costs of chemicals required for digesting the husk are appeared to be major bottlenecks while using it commercially. Possibilities of producing activated carbon from the husk has offered promising result. Areca husk can be used as a manure as it contains 1.0-1.1 percent N2, 0.4-0.5 percent P2O2 and 1.0 - l.5 percent K2o. Therefore, it could be a good organic manure if properly composted. However, advanced research is suggested since it is resistant to microbial-degradation. Another possibility is that it can be used as raw material for preparing ready-made toys, flowers, garlands and decorative ornaments and many types of show case pieces.<br><br>

      (II) MEDICINAL USES:<br><br>
      It can be said that areca nut and its components with other elements could be used in human medicines like thread worms, tape worms, skin problems, cough, fits, anemia, obesity, nasal ulcers, appetizing effect, blood pressure, bleeding gums, sore lips dysentery, hook worms, taenio infections, helminthic infections, purgative effects and for calcium deficiencies. Apart from this it can be also used in veterinary medicine in expelling worms, skin problems soaring, bleeding problems, bleeding gums, hook worms thread and tape worms. Even areca components could be used to prepare medicines in Synus, Gangrin, Herfis, Tooth-ache, Virus diseases. It could be a best medicine for itching problems a skin disease. Hence areca is an effective blood purifier.<br><br>
